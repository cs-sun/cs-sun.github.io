This is a test post to verify the blog system works correctly with multiple posts.

## Testing Different Features

Let me test various markdown features to ensure everything renders properly.

### Mathematics

Here's a quadratic equation:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

And some inline math: The sum $\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is well-known.

### Code Examples

Python code with syntax:

```python
class BlogPost:
    def __init__(self, title, date):
        self.title = title
        self.date = date

    def render(self):
        return f"<h1>{self.title}</h1>"
```

JavaScript example:

```javascript
const fetchPosts = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/posts');
    return response.json();
};
```

### Tables

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Math rendering | ✓ | KaTeX works |
| Code blocks | ✓ | Simple CSS styling |
| Tables | ✓ | Native markdown |

### Lists and Formatting

**Bold text** and *italic text* work as expected.

Unordered list:
- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

Ordered list:
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

### Block Quote

> This is a quote block. It should have a left border and different background color to distinguish it from regular text.

## Conclusion

This test post demonstrates that all major markdown features are working correctly in the blog system.
